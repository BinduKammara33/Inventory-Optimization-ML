>I’m passionate about using AI to solve real-world business problems.


Inventory Optimization with Machine Learning
========================================================
Managing inventory is always a balancing act:
>Too much stock → wasted money on storage
>Too little stock → unhappy customers and lost sales
This project shows how data + machine learning can help businesses make smarter inventory decisions.
It combines classical supply chain formulas with modern ML forecasting to find the right balance between cost and service level.

 What this project does
----------------------------
> Simulates inventory levels day by day.
> Helps choose the best reorder point and order quantity.
> Shows the trade-off between cost and service level.
> Uses Machine Learning (LightGBM) to forecast future. demand.
>Provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard so anyone can play with the numbers.

What it looks like
==================
When you run the dashboard, you’ll see:
-----------------------------------------------
>Inventory going up when you order, and down as customers buy.
>A curve showing how costs change when you increase service level.
>Forecast vs. actual demand using ML

How to run it
=============
>First,Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Inventory-Optimization-ML.git
cd Inventory-Optimization-ML
>Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate it:
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
>Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
>Run the app
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
#it will default opens the browser and shows the streamlit UI orelse you can just copy the link(http://localhost:8501/) you will get in the terminal after running the command and explore.

Why this project matters
========================
>For businesses → saves money by reducing overstock and stockouts.
>For recruiters/managers → shows applied ML in a real-world use case.
>For me → a way to combine supply chain knowledge with AI skills.

Future Improvements
====================
>Add more ML models (ARIMA, Prophet, RandomForest).
>Generate confidence bands for forecasts (not just single values).
>Export reports to Excel/PDF for business users.
>Add a chatbot that explains results in plain English.
